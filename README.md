- 👋 Hi, I’m @DianaCatalinaP
- 👀 Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate Junior Manual Tester with a keen eye for detail and a strong commitment to ensuring software quality. My focus is on identifying bugs, enhancing user experience, and collaborating with developers to deliver reliable and user-friendly applications.
- 🌱 I have a solid foundation in manual QA with extensive experience in collaborating with development teams to deliver high-quality software products. My expertise includes designing and executing test cases, thorough bug reporting, and contributing to test planning. Currently, I’m advancing my skill set by learning about databases, focusing on SQL queries and database management. This knowledge will allow me to conduct more comprehensive data validation, ensure data integrity, and perform in-depth database testing to further improve the overall quality assurance process.

I’m particularly interested in working on teams that value quality assurance as a critical part of the development process, and where I can also contribute to database testing and data validation as I continue to expand my skills in this area.
